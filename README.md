# csharp-banking-app
This project was built while working through the Microsoft Learn quickstart exercises on developing object-oriented applications in C#.

Rather than completing each exercise in separate module folders, the application was built as a single evolving project to better reflect real-world development practices and maintain a continuous Git history.

## Purpose
The repository is used to strengthen my understanding of:

- C#  
- .NET  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Git and GitHub workflows

## Status
Active learning project.
